# M.O.T.H.E.R. — Modular Omniscient Thinking Hyper-adaptive Embodied Reasoner

> The first AGI prototype built by a student — a system of interconnected narrow AIs designed to think, reflect, adapt, and transfer knowledge across domains.

## 🧠 What is MOTHER?

M.O.T.H.E.R. is a modular AGI framework built by [Visho Malla Oli](https://github.com/yourusername) that combines foundational models (LLMs, vision models, memory, planning agents) into a unified system capable of:

- Task decomposition and multi-agent orchestration
- Real-time memory and reflection
- Multimodal reasoning (text, vision, speech, code)
- Transfer learning between tasks
- Self-correction and adaptation

## 🔤 Acronym

- **M**odular  
- **O**mniscient  
- **T**hinking  
- **H**yper-adaptive  
- **E**mbodied  
- **R**easoner

---

## ⚙️ Architecture

MOTHER consists of 5 key components:

1. **Language Core** — Powered by open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA or Mistral)
2. **Perception Unit** — CLIP + SAM for visual grounding
3. **Memory Bank** — Vector-based + symbolic memory storage
4. **Reasoning Loop** — Reflexion/ReAct-style self-improvement engine
5. **Control Layer** — Agent router / task allocator

---

## 🚀 MVP Capabilities (Phase 1)

- Reflective Q&A (detects and fixes hallucinated answers)
- Math tutor that visualizes and self-assesses
- Simple planning agent with memory
- Knowledge transfer across subtasks

---

## 🧪 Research Scope

This project also forms the basis of my senior thesis on:

> "The Use Case and Viability of Modular AGI Systems in Real-World Tasks"

---

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Build architecture skeleton with LangChain or custom router
- [ ] Implement memory system (FAISS or JSON + metadata)
- [ ] Connect LLM to vision module
- [ ] Add reflection + retry loop
- [ ] Deploy interactive web demo
